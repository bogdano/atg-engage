The Missoula Cognizant branch was in a period of transitioning back to a hybrid work environment after the Covid pandemic. They were looking for a fun way to help build camaraderie and
encourage employees to engage with their colleagues after a period of working exclusively from home. Given the common competitive streak among all of the stakeholders that we interviewed,
it made sense to create a gamified platform, and our main inspiration in terms of UX was Duolingo.

The app was built with minimal dependencies. Django on the backend, HTMX on the frontend. Mailjet was integrated for the magic link login functionality, and certain
notifications.
